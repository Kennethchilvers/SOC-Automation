Overview:
The goal of this project is to start from scratch and get a fully integrated SOAR solution with case management. 
This will be accomplished by leveraging multiple open source softwares such as Wazuh, TheHive, Shuffle, and Sysmon.
As a proof of concept the project will focus on utilizing Sysmon and Wazuh to detect Mimikatz, this detection will then be sent to Shuffle.
Shuffle is going to work as the main SOAR platform to integrate all systems together, the detection will then be sent as an alert to TheHive for case management.

Individual parts:
As shown in the network diagram for the project Wazuh, TheHive, and Shuffle will all be hosted in the cloud. Wazuh and TheHive being hosted by cloud based vms
from digitalocean.
